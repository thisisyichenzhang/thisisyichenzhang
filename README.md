### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


#### I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at UBC working on Interpretable latent variable methods for biological data analysis. Iâ€™m currently working towards my Ph.D. dissertation and am open to job opportunities starting in May 2024 and ahead. 

My research on Interpretable latent variable models has involved several techniques. 

To name a few: ***topic modelling***, ***variational autoencoder***, ***matrix factorization*** and ***Bayesian networks***. Check out the following projects for details.

- [Unraveling dynamically-encoded latent transcriptomic patterns in pancreatic cancer cells by topic modelling, Zhang et al, Cell Genomics, 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100388)
- [DeepPLIER: A deep learning approach to pathway-level representation of gene expression data, Zhang et al, MLCSB, ISMB, 2020.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBlBFG6gFbM)
- [Scaled Matrix Completion](http://hdl.handle.net/1773/42982).

Prior to my Ph.D. study, I finished my ***Master's in Biostatistics*** at the University of Washington, working on matrix completion and cell deconvolution problems. 

- I was a ***Biostatistician Intern*** at [NanoString Technologies, Inc.](https://nanostring.com/), working on cell deconvolution problems. 

- I was an ***Associate Researcher Intern*** at [Huawei AI Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/) working on video recognition. Check out here: [Dynamic Cross-scale Aggregation and Multi-Head Interactions for Temporal Action Localization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGILnxpsuw&ab_channel=ActivityNet).

I have been working as a ***Senior Statistical Consultant*** in [Applied Statistics and Data Science Group](https://asda.stat.ubc.ca/).
